## 📂 Projects Included

1_Customer Churn Prediction
**File:** `churn_prediction_model.ipynb`

**Description:**
This project aims to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave a service) based on historical customer data. The notebook covers:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning model building
- Model evaluation and performance analysis

**Goal:**  
Help businesses identify high-risk customers and take preventive actions to reduce churn.

2_Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis & K-Means
**File:** `Customer_Segmentation_Using_RFM_Analysis_and_K_Means_Clustering.ipynb`

**Description:**
This project segments customers based on their purchasing behavior using:
- **RFM Analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- **K-Means Clustering**

The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing
- RFM feature creation
- Optimal cluster selection
- Customer segmentation visualization
- Business insights from clusters



**Goal:**  
Enable targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer engagement.
